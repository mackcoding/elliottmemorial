                                Elliott was more than just a pet - Elliott was a
                                faithful companion. He was a bossy dog who often
                                became the alpha in every situation. Elliott was
                                always a gentle, kind, and loving dog. He loved
                                toy ducks, chasing cats, swimming, camping, ice
                                cream, car rides, and watching TV. Elliott
                                brought smiles and laughter to everyone who met
                                him. He will always be remembered as a good boy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Elliott had a love for being the boss, whether
                                it was keeping his German Shepherd brother Renzo
                                from having toys, stealing Renzo's bones and
                                toys, or demanding that it was bedtime by
                                standing in the bedroom barking non-stop.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On Tuesday, October the 7th in 2025, Elliott
                                began showing signs of distress. By the early
                                evening, he was rushed to Pet's ER. With fluids,
                                he was once again walking on his own but showing
                                signs of distress. Around 11:00 PM on October
                                7th, I received a call that I needed to return.
                                At this time, we believe that Elliott had a
                                stroke. He had become immobile and was not fully
                                responsive. Elliott's eyes watched me as I gave
                                him pets and talked to him. Around 12:10 AM, his
                                breathing changed and two minutes later, Elliott
                                passed away peacefully. He was around 12 years
                                old.
