                                Elliott was more than just a pet - Elliott was a
                                faithful companion. He was a bossy dog who often
                                became the alpha in every situation. Elliott was
                                always a gentle, kind, and loving dog. He loved
                                toy ducks, chasing cats, swimming, camping, ice
                                cream, car rides, and watching TV. Elliott
                                brought smiles and laughter to everyone who met
                                him. He will always be remembered as a good boy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Elliott had a love for being the boss, whether
                                it was keeping his German Shepherd brother Renzo
                                from having toys, stealing Renzo's bones and
                                toys, or demanding that it was bedtime by
                                standing in the bedroom barking non-stop.

                                On Tuesday, October the 7th in 2025, Elliott
                                began showing signs of distress. By the early
                                evening, he was rushed to
                                <a
                                    href="https://www.petservet.com/"
                                    target="_blank"
                                    >Pet's ER</a
                                >. With fluids, he was once again walking on his
                                own but showing signs of distress. Around 11:00
                                PM on October 7th, I received a call that I
                                needed to return. At this time, we believe that
                                Elliott had a stroke. He had become immobile and
                                was not fully responsive. Elliott's eyes watched
                                me as I gave him pets and talked to him. Around
                                12:10 AM, his breathing changed and two minutes
                                later, Elliott passed away peacefully. He was
                                around 12 years old.
